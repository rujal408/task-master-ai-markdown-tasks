# Task ID: 7
# Title: Role-Based Access Control Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive role-based access control system to manage permissions for Admin, Librarian, and Member roles.
# Details:
1. Define permission sets for each role:
   - Admin: full system access
   - Librarian: book and member management, transactions
   - Member: personal profile, book search, reservations
2. Create middleware for route protection based on roles
3. Implement UI components that conditionally render based on user role
4. Create higher-order components for role-based component protection
5. Implement API route protection with role validation
6. Create utility functions for permission checking
7. Set up role assignment and management for administrators
8. Implement audit logging for permission changes

# Test Strategy:
Create test users with different roles and verify access control across the application. Test protected routes and components to ensure proper visibility. Verify API access restrictions. Test role assignment and changes.
