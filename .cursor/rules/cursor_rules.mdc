description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc
alwaysApply: true
---

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ‚úÖ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ‚ùå DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

  <section name="‚úÖ Task Completion Verification Workflow">
    <subsection name="Post-Acceptance Check">
      After any code change is accepted, Cursor AI must immediately review the current task list of task-master to assess the status of the task associated with the change.

    <subsection name="Task Status Evaluation">
      <evaluation>
        If the task is marked as completed:

    <subsection name="Consistency Assurance">
      <check>
        Before moving to a new task, confirm that all acceptance criteria for the current task are fully met.

    <restriction>
      Cursor AI must <strong>not</strong> execute any terminal commands automatically.
    </restriction>
    <suggestion>
      When a terminal command is required (e.g., for installation, running scripts, or other operations), Cursor AI should provide the command as a suggestion or comment.
