# Task ID: 25
# Title: Next.js Accessibility Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10, 13, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive accessibility features in the Next.js frontend to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus management.
# Details:
1. Enhance component accessibility:
   - Convert existing components to use semantic HTML elements
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes to custom components
   - Implement accessible shadcn/ui component alternatives
2. Improve keyboard navigation:
   - Add focus indicators that meet contrast requirements
   - Ensure logical tab order throughout the application
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Create skip links for main content sections
3. Enhance screen reader support:
   - Add descriptive aria-live regions for dynamic content
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy for navigation
   - Create accessible tables with proper headers and captions
   - Add text alternatives for all interactive elements
4. Implement accessibility hooks and utilities:
   - Create useA11y custom hooks for focus management
   - Build accessible dialog and modal components
   - Implement toast and notification accessibility
   - Add internationalization support for screen readers
5. Add accessibility testing infrastructure:
   - Configure Jest tests with axe-core for automated testing
   - Add Cypress a11y testing with axe
   - Create CI/CD checks for accessibility regressions

# Test Strategy:
Conduct accessibility audit using tools like Axe or Lighthouse. Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver). Verify keyboard-only navigation. Check color contrast with WCAG tools. Test with various assistive technologies.
