# Overview  
The Library Management System is a modern web application designed to automate and streamline library operations. It provides librarians with powerful tools to manage books, members, and transactions efficiently while offering members a seamless experience for discovering and borrowing books. The system will be built using Next.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

# Core Features  
1. **User Management**
   - Secure authentication system with role-based access control (Admin, Librarian, Member)
   - User profile management and password reset functionality
   - Important for maintaining security and proper access levels

2. **Book Management**
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations for book records
   - Advanced search with filtering by categories, tags, and availability
   - ISBN validation and book status tracking
   - Book cover image management

3. **Member Management**
   - Member registration and profile management
   - Membership status tracking and history
   - Search and filter members efficiently

4. **Borrowing System**
   - Streamlined book checkout and return processes
   - Automated due date and fine calculations
   - Book reservation system
   - Overdue notifications

5. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Inventory and transaction reports
   - Member activity analytics
   - Fine collection and overdue tracking
   - Popular books and usage statistics

# User Experience  
## User Personas
1. **Librarian**
   - Primary user managing daily operations
   - Needs efficient tools for book and member management
   - Requires quick access to reports and analytics

2. **Library Member**
   - Wants to easily search and borrow books
   - Needs self-service options for account management
   - Values notifications for due dates and reservations

## Key User Flows
1. **Book Checkout Flow**
   - Member searches for a book
   - Views availability and checks out
   - Receives due date confirmation

2. **Member Registration Flow**
   - New member fills registration form
   - Account verification
   - Welcome email with login details

3. **Report Generation Flow**
   - Librarian selects report type and parameters
   - System generates and displays report
   - Option to export in multiple formats

## UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Intuitive navigation and search functionality
- Clear visual hierarchy and feedback mechanisms
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Dark/light mode support

# Technical Architecture  
## System Components
1. **Frontend**
   - Next.js with TypeScript
   - React Query for data fetching
   - React Hook Form + Zod for form handling
   - Shadcn/ui component library
   - Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Backend**
   - Next.js API routes
   - Prisma ORM for database operations
   - JWT for authentication
   - AWS S3 for file storage

3. **Database**

   - Prisma migrations for schema management
   - Optimized indexes for search performance

## Data Models
1. **User**
   - id, email, passwordHash, role, name, status
   - Relations: transactions, reservations

2. **Book**
   - id, isbn, title, author, category, status
   - Relations: transactions, reservations

3. **Transaction**
   - id, bookId, userId, checkoutDate, dueDate, returnDate, fine
   - Relations: book, user

4. **Reservation**
   - id, bookId, userId, reservationDate, status
   - Relations: book, user

## APIs
1. **Auth**
   - POST /api/auth/register
   - POST /api/auth/login
   - POST /api/auth/forgot-password

2. **Books**
   - GET /api/books
   - POST /api/books
   - GET /api/books/:id
   - PUT /api/books/:id
   - DELETE /api/books/:id

3. **Members**
   - GET /api/members
   - POST /api/members
   - GET /api/members/:id
   - PUT /api/members/:id

4. **Transactions**
   - POST /api/transactions/checkout
   - POST /api/transactions/return
   - GET /api/transactions/overdue
