# Task ID: 12
# Title: Member Model and API Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Member model with Prisma and create RESTful API endpoints for member management.
# Details:
1. Enhance User model in Prisma schema for member-specific fields:
   - address
   - phoneNumber
   - membershipStartDate
   - membershipEndDate
   - membershipStatus
   - borrowingLimit
2. Create API routes for member operations:
   - GET /api/members (with pagination, filtering)
   - POST /api/members (create new member)
   - GET /api/members/:id (get member details)
   - PUT /api/members/:id (update member)
3. Implement validation using Zod schemas
4. Create database queries with Prisma
5. Add role-based access control to endpoints
6. Implement proper error handling and status codes
7. Create member status management logic

# Test Strategy:
Test all API endpoints with valid and invalid data. Verify proper validation for member data. Test pagination and filtering functionality. Ensure proper error responses. Verify role-based access control for each endpoint.
