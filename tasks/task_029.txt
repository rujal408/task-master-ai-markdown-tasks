# Task ID: 29
# Title: Next.js Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 13, 15, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize frontend performance to meet targets for page load times, rendering speed, and user experience metrics.
# Details:
1. Implement React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
2. Optimize component rendering with memoization
3. Implement code splitting and lazy loading
4. Add component-level performance optimizations
5. Implement client-side caching strategies
6. Add image optimization with next/image
7. Configure prefetching for common navigation paths
8. Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
9. Implement server-side rendering for key pages
