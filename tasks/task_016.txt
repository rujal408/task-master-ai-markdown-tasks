# Task ID: 16
# Title: Reservation System Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 12, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement book reservation system allowing members to reserve books that are currently unavailable.
# Details:
1. Enhance Reservation model in Prisma schema if needed
2. Create API routes for reservation operations:
   - POST /api/reservations (create reservation)
   - GET /api/reservations (list with filtering)
   - PUT /api/reservations/:id (update status)
   - DELETE /api/reservations/:id (cancel)
3. Implement business logic for:
   - Availability checking
   - Reservation queue management
   - Notification triggers
   - Expiration handling
4. Create UI components for:
   - Reservation creation
   - Reservation management
   - Reservation queue display
5. Implement reservation status workflow
6. Add role-based access control to endpoints

# Test Strategy:
Test reservation creation, fulfillment, and cancellation flows. Verify queue management for multiple reservations. Test notification triggers. Ensure proper status updates for books and reservations. Test edge cases like reservation expiration.
