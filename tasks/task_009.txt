# Task ID: 9
# Title: Book Model and API Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Book model with Prisma and create RESTful API endpoints for book management.
# Details:
1. Enhance Book model in Prisma schema with additional fields:
   - publishedDate
   - publisher
   - description
   - coverImageUrl
   - pageCount
   - language
   - tags (as an array)
2. Create API routes for book operations:
   - GET /api/books (with pagination, filtering)
   - POST /api/books (create new book)
   - GET /api/books/:id (get book details)
   - PUT /api/books/:id (update book)
   - DELETE /api/books/:id (delete book)
3. Implement validation using Zod schemas
4. Add ISBN validation utility
5. Create database queries with Prisma
6. Implement proper error handling and status codes
7. Add role-based access control to endpoints

# Test Strategy:
Test all API endpoints with valid and invalid data. Verify proper validation, especially for ISBN. Test pagination and filtering functionality. Ensure proper error responses. Verify role-based access control for each endpoint.
